# MITM-BLE-GO
Man in middle(MITM) protection for BLE devices &amp; network

####  This script will scan for BLE devices and print their names and services. It will also check if the device supports Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) protection, which is a security feature that protects against attacks where an attacker intercepts and manipulates communication between two devices.

> Note that this script is just a basic example, and there are many other security features and vulnerabilities that you may want to check for. You may also want to consider using additional libraries or tools!
